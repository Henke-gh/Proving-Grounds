Here you can test your mettle against all manner of foes.

The Proving Grounds is my attempt, as a coding novice, at creating a text-based combat focused light RPG. The (current) goal of the game is simple: Survive the duels and grow stronger so that you may take on ever tougher enemies.

Swing wildly into the unknown!

This project is developed, code and assets all, by me in an attempt to put into practice what I've learnt and continue to learn on my coding journey.
Trying new things, relearning old ones. The game is as of this writing in a state of constant flux as I add or tweak different aspects of it regularly.

If you stumbled upon this repo and checked the game out, please feel free to offer feedback or advice!
